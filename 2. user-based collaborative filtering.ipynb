    "## Limitations of user-based CF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b> Sparsity </b> : In general, users interact with less than 20% of items. This leads the rating matrix to be highly sparse. For example, the movielen-100k contains 100k ratings from 943 users on 1682 items. The pourcentage of sparsity in this case is around $94\\%$. A recommender system based on nearest neighbor algorithms may be unable to make any item recommendations for a particular user. As a result the accuracy of recommendations may be poor <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/371920.372071\">(Sarwar <i>et al.</i> 2001)</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b> Stability of user's ratings </b> : As a user rates and re-rates items, their rating vector will change along with their similarity to other users. A user’s neighborhood is determined not only by their ratings but also by the ratings of other users, so their neighborhood can change as a result of new ratings supplied by any user in the system <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1100000009\">(Michael D. Ekstrand, <i>et al.</i> 2011)</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b> Scalability </b> : Due to the non-stability of users ratings, finding similar users in advance is complicated. For this reason, most user-based CF systems find neighborhoods each time predictions or recommendations are needed. However, these are huge computations that grows with both the number of users and the number of items. With millions of users and items, a typical web-based recommender system running existing algorithms will suffer serious scalability concerns <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/371920.372071\">(Sarwar <i>et al.</i> 2001)</a>, <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1100000009\">(Michael D.
